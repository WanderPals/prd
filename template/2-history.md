# History

During this semester, we created a collaborative travel application enabling each participant in the “trip” to add points of interest to the trip. The application includes various features.
We've added the possibility of adding expenses during the trip, so that we can track individual and group expenses. Each expense creates a debt that must be repaid by those designated by the debt creator. Debts can be visually observed through the debt screen and a pie chart. 

In the Map tab we can add stop suggestions (= future Interest points to visit) but also see where the other people on the trip are. However, we can also create them from the suggestion screen. In this screen, trip participants can vote for each suggestion. A majority of these suggestions will become real stops. Teammates can also add comments. A diary page completes the picture, offering a visualization of the different stops over time.

We've also introduced a section for uploading travel documents for private or shared use.
Finally, we've added a notification and announcement area. In this tab, we've added an overview of all the actions of each of the teammates, and in the announcements we've included all the important information for each of the trip's travelers (remainder for passports, etc.). What's more, each user can consult his or her own data and role and some persons can update a role.


*What did you learn?*

Working on this application as part of a group of seven students in our course has been a highly enriching experience. We gained a comprehensive understanding of Jetpack Compose, Google's modern toolkit for building native UIs, which included mastering composables, state management, and the declarative UI paradigm. We utilized Kotlin Coroutines for handling asynchronous tasks, ensuring smooth and responsive user experiences, and implemented Material Design principles to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces using Jetpack Compose.

Using Git for version control was essential for managing our codebase collaboratively, where we learned to handle branches, pull requests, and code reviews efficiently. Regular meetings and updates, both in person and via tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, were crucial for maintaining team alignment and promptly addressing issues. Adopting Agile practices such as sprints, stand-ups, and retrospectives helped us stay organized and adapt to evolving requirements and challenges. Balancing this project with our coursework and other commitments taught us valuable time management skills, ensuring productivity and goal achievement. We also learned how to design and implement a user-friendly interface, considering factors such as usability, accessibility, and performance.

*What is missing to bridge from PoC to MVP?*

To transition from PoC to MVP, the following gaps need to be addressed:

## Feature Completion:

Ensure all core features listed in the PRD are fully developed and integrated.
Complete the pending functionalities like the finance management tool, offline access, and comprehensive notification system.

## Enhanced Testing:

Implement more robust testing mechanisms, including automated tests, to ensure the app’s reliability.
Conduct extensive UAT to identify and resolve usability issues.

## Performance Optimization:

Optimize the app for performance, including load times, responsiveness, and resource usage.
Address any performance bottlenecks identified during testing.

## Security Measures:

Implement comprehensive security measures to protect user data and ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and COPPA.
Conduct security audits and vulnerability assessments.

## Scalability Planning:

Ensure the backend infrastructure can handle increased load as the user base grows.
Implement scalability solutions like cloud-based infrastructure and load balancing.

## Documentation and Training:

Develop comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
Provide training and support materials to help users get the most out of the app.

## Feedback Loop:

Establish a continuous feedback loop with users to gather insights and make iterative improvements.
Prioritize feedback implementation based on impact and feasibility.
By addressing these areas, the project can effectively transition from PoC to a fully functional MVP, setting the stage for further development and eventual market success.
