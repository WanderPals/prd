# History

During this semester, we developed a collaborative travel application that allows each participant in a trip to add points of interest. The application includes various features.

We implemented the ability to add expenses during the trip to track both individual and group expenses. Each expense creates a debt that must be repaid by those designated by the debt creator. Debts can be viewed through a debt screen and visualized with a pie chart.

In the Map tab, users can add stop suggestions (future points of interest) and see the locations of other trip participants. Suggestions can also be created from the suggestion screen, where participants can vote on each suggestion. Suggestions with a majority vote become actual stops, and teammates can add comments. A diary page provides a visualization of the different stops over time.

We introduced a section for uploading travel documents for private or shared use. Additionally, we added a notification and announcement area. This tab offers an overview of all teammates' actions and includes important announcements for travelers (such as passport reminders). Each user can view their own data and role, and certain users can update roles.

*What did you learn?*

Working on this application as part of a group of seven students in our course has been a highly enriching experience. We gained a comprehensive understanding of Jetpack Compose, Google's modern toolkit for building native UIs, which included mastering composables, state management, and the declarative UI paradigm. We utilized Kotlin Coroutines for handling asynchronous tasks, ensuring smooth and responsive user experiences, and implemented Material Design principles to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces using Jetpack Compose.

Using Git for version control was essential for managing our codebase collaboratively, where we learned to handle branches, pull requests, and code reviews efficiently. Regular meetings and updates, both in person and via tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, were crucial for maintaining team alignment and promptly addressing issues. Adopting Agile practices such as sprints, stand-ups, and retrospectives helped us stay organized and adapt to evolving requirements and challenges. Balancing this project with our coursework and other commitments taught us valuable time management skills, ensuring productivity and goal achievement. We also learned how to design and implement a user-friendly interface, considering factors such as usability, accessibility, and performance.

*What is missing to bridge from PoC to MVP?*

To transition from PoC to MVP, the following gaps need to be addressed:

### Feature Completion:

Ensure all core features listed in the PRD are fully developed and integrated.
Complete the pending functionalities like the finance management tool, offline access, and comprehensive notification system.

### Enhanced Testing:

Implement more robust testing mechanisms, including automated tests, to ensure the appâ€™s reliability.
Conduct extensive UAT to identify and resolve usability issues.

### Performance Optimization:

Optimize the app for performance, including load times, responsiveness, and resource usage.
Address any performance bottlenecks identified during testing.

### Security Measures:

Implement comprehensive security measures to protect user data and ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and COPPA.
Conduct security audits and vulnerability assessments.

### Scalability Planning:

Ensure the backend infrastructure can handle increased load as the user base grows.
Implement scalability solutions like cloud-based infrastructure and load balancing.

### Documentation and Training:

Develop comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
Provide training and support materials to help users get the most out of the app.

### Feedback Loop:

Establish a continuous feedback loop with users to gather insights and make iterative improvements.
Prioritize feedback implementation based on impact and feasibility.
By addressing these areas, the project can effectively transition from PoC to a fully functional MVP, setting the stage for further development and eventual market success.
