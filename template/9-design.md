## Data Model

**What Data Are You Collecting/Managing?**

*User Data:*
- Profile information (name, email, phone number, profile picture)
- Authentication credentials (hashed passwords)
- Role and permissions

*Trip Data:*
- Trip details (destination, dates, description)
- Itinerary and scheduled activities
- List of participants and their roles

*Activity Data:*
- Activity suggestions
- Votes and preferences

*Notification Data:*
- Notification messages
- Delivery status

*Location Data:*
- Real-time location coordinates
- Privacy settings

*File Data:*
- Uploaded documents (itineraries, tickets, photos)
- Access permissions

*Finance Data:*
- Expense records
- Cost splitting details
- Budget information

**How Is It Organised?**

*Database Structure:*
- **Users Table**: Stores user profile information, authentication credentials, and roles.
- **Trips Table**: Contains trip details, including destination, dates, description, and associated participants.
- **Activities Table**: Holds information about suggested activities and votes.
- **Notifications Table**: Logs notification messages and delivery status.
- **Locations Table**: Tracks real-time location data with associated privacy settings.
- **Files Table**: Manages uploaded documents and their access permissions.
- **Finance Table**: Records expenses, cost splitting details, and budget information.

**Where Is It Stored?**

*Primary Storage:*
- **Database**: A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store structured data such as user profiles, trip details, activities, notifications, and finance data.
- **File Storage**: A cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) to store documents and media files.

**How Is It Shared/Copied/Cached?**

*Data Sharing:*
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs to enable communication between the frontend and backend, facilitating data retrieval and updates.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Ensures that data is shared based on user roles and permissions.

*Data Caching:*
- **In-Memory Caching**: Use of caching solutions (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to cache frequently accessed data and reduce database load.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Distributes static files (documents, media) to improve access speed and reduce server load.

*Data Copying:*
- **Backup and Replication**: Regular backups and database replication to ensure data redundancy and disaster recovery.
- **Data Syncing**: Synchronization mechanisms to ensure data consistency across different components and services.
