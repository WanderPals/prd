## Features Outside the Scope

*The MVP must be viable and minimal.*

*Which features don’t belong in it.*

*How should these be eventually integrated and in what sequence.*

To ensure that the MVP for WanderPals remains both viable and minimal, certain features will be deferred for future development. The following features do not belong in the MVP and will be integrated in subsequent phases:

### Features to Defer and Future Integration Plan

1. **Advanced Analytics and Reporting:**
    - **Rationale:** Detailed analytics are valuable for long-term insights but are not essential for initial trip planning and coordination.
    - **Integration Sequence:** Introduce basic analytics in the first post-MVP release, followed by more advanced reporting tools in subsequent updates.

2. **Social Media Integration:**
    - **Rationale:** While useful for sharing trips and increasing visibility, social media integration is not critical for the core functionality of trip planning.
    - **Integration Sequence:** Add simple sharing options in the first post-MVP update, with full social media integration and in-app sharing features in later versions.

3. **In-app Booking and Reservations:**
    - **Rationale:** Booking flights, hotels, and activities directly through the app requires significant development and partnerships with service providers.
    - **Integration Sequence:** Start by integrating third-party booking links in the first post-MVP release, followed by direct booking capabilities in future versions.

4. **AI-powered Recommendations:**
    - **Rationale:** Advanced AI features for personalized recommendations add complexity and are not necessary for the initial launch.
    - **Integration Sequence:** Implement basic recommendations based on user data in early post-MVP updates, with advanced AI-powered suggestions in later stages.

5. **Multi-language Support:**
    - **Rationale:** While important for global reach, multi-language support can be added once the app has proven successful in a single language.
    - **Integration Sequence:** Add support for additional languages in phases, starting with the most requested languages in early post-MVP updates.

6. **Customization and Personalization Features:**
    - **Rationale:** Advanced customization options for user profiles and trip themes can enhance the user experience but are not critical for initial functionality.
    - **Integration Sequence:** Introduce basic customization features in early post-MVP updates, expanding to more advanced personalization options over time.

7. **Offline Mode:**
    - **Rationale:** Enabling full offline functionality is complex. Basic offline access is important for initial usability, but full offline editing can be deferred.
    - **Integration Sequence:** Include basic offline access in the initial post-MVP release, allowing users to view trip itineraries without modifying anything. Full offline functionality can be introduced in later stages.

### Integration Sequence Plan

1. **Initial Post-MVP (Next 3-6 months):**
    - Basic analytics and reporting
    - Simple social media sharing
    - Third-party booking links
    - Basic recommendations
    - Basic offline access (view-only mode)

2. **Mid-term Updates (6-12 months):**
    - Multi-language support (starting with the most requested languages)
    - Advanced analytics
    - Direct booking capabilities
    - Enhanced AI-powered recommendations
    - Deeper social media integration
